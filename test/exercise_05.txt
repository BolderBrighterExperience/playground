Hints:
Bulk SQL minimizes the performance overhead of the communication between PL/SQL and SQL.
PL/SQL and SQL communicate as follows: To run a SELECT INTO or DML statement, the PL/SQL engine sends the query or DML statement to the SQL engine. The SQL engine runs the query or DML statement and returns the result to the PL/SQL engine.
The PL/SQL features that comprise bulk SQL are the FORALL statement and the BULK COLLECT clause. 
The FORALL statement sends DML statements from PL/SQL to SQL in batches rather than one at a time. 
The BULK COLLECT clause returns results from SQL to PL/SQL in batches rather than one at a time. 
If a query or DML statement affects four or more database rows, then bulk SQL can significantly improve performance.
