I create and populate my customers table as follows:

CREATE TABLE plch_customers
(
   custnum    INTEGER
 , custname   VARCHAR2 (100)
)
/

BEGIN
   INSERT INTO plch_customers
        VALUES (1, 'Oracle Corporation');

   INSERT INTO plch_customers
        VALUES (100, 'Quest Software');

   INSERT INTO plch_customers
        VALUES (500, 'Feuerstein and Associates');

   COMMIT;
END;
/
Write an implementation of the plch_show_customers procedure so that the following text is displayed after execution of the block shown below:

Feuerstein and Associates
Oracle Corporation
Quest Software
And the block:

BEGIN
   plch_show_customers (
     'select custname from plch_customers order by custname');
END;
/

Hint: Use EXECUTE IMMEDIATE & BULK COLLECT INTO, OPEN cursor FOR & FETCH INTO
PL/SQL offers a number of ways to retrieve multiple rows from a dynamic SQL query; 
OPEN-FOR is especially helpful when you plan to use the BULK COLLECT clause as you fetch, 
but also want to use the LIMIT clause to manage memory consumption.
